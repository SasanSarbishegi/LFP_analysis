# LFP_analysis
we undertake the analysis of the LFP signal derived from the brain of an anesthetized rat during an olfactory task.
The LFP signal that is given to you comprises three distinct channels:\
1.Hippocampus (HPC)\
2. Olfactory Tubercle (OT)\
3. Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)\
We apply several methods (PLV, l-PAC, and ir-PAC) across different channels for ERP signals in the olfactory task, aiming to investigate the effects of odorants on the connectivity between these channels.
